Buskey Jump
============

Playable on the [gh-pages branch](http://justinsoon.github.io/buskeyjump)

About
-----
A Doodle Jump clone for AP Comp Sci.

Use the arrow keys to navigate your ever-jumping Buskey and collect Dr. Pepper for extra points.
Push higher with the maroon platforms, watch out from the purple, they'll be pulled from under you.
Yellow Rectangles will teleport you around 100 levels further.


Technicals
----------
Best playable on Chrome, works in FF (less FPS), fails on IE9 (getter\setters) and untested on others...
I've used the Octicons font instead of sprites for the pickups, saves bandwidth and scales better,
at the prices of more CSS3 effects.
Overall, not a lot of canvas is used, which means less performance, as the DOM gets updated often.
